## WHO IS TERRY WEBER

### The Elevator Pitch
Terry Weber is a nationally recognized transformation CEO who scales founder-led companies into industry leaders. One of the few executives to run major companies across healthcare, retail, technology, and automotive — and deliver wins in all of them.

### What Makes Her Different (Use These Angles)

**1. SPAC Survivor** — She took Biote public via SPAC in 2022 and *stayed as CEO for years afterward*. Most SPAC CEOs fail or get replaced. She landed it, executed it, and sustained performance post-listing. That's elite.

**2. Corporate Firefighter** — Boards hire her when things are on fire and they need a grownup. Discount Auto → Frederick's → Amen Clinics → Biote. That's not a random career — it's a pattern of rescuing companies.

**3. Founder Whisperer** — She thrives in founder-led chaos. She can fix the mess, keep the founder happy, AND scale the company. Very few CEOs can do all three.

**4. Six-Industry Pattern Matcher** — Automotive, retail, consumer health, neuroscience, nutraceuticals, beauty/apparel, finance. Most CEOs master one vertical. She reads patterns across all of them.

**5. National Media Platform** — USA Today, Forbes, Fast Company, NY Times, Business Insider, Kiplinger. She's not just an operator — she's a thought leader with reach.

**6. SEC Audit Committee Qualified** — Boards desperately need directors who understand audit and risk. This credential makes her immediately recruitable.

## THE 10 POWER DIFFERENTIATORS (What Her Résumé Undersells)

These are the real positioning angles that separate "CEO résumé" from "elite-level operator":

### 1. SPAC Survivor
She took Biote public via SPAC in 2022 — and stayed as CEO for years afterward. Most SPAC CEOs fail or get replaced. She landed it, executed it, and sustained performance post-listing. That's extremely rare.

### 2. Corporate Firefighter
Auto parts retailers, lingerie companies, brain-health clinics, hormone-therapy networks — these are "unsexy," operationally brutal industries. She fixes broken operations, rebuilds leadership systems, modernizes brands, introduces technology, and scales them profitably. Boards hire her when things are on fire and they need a grownup.

### 3. Founder Whisperer
Founder-led companies = chaos + emotion + lack of process. She's done this multiple times. Very few CEOs can fix founder chaos, keep the founder happy, AND scale the company anyway.

### 4. Repeat Turnaround CEO
Discount Auto → Frederick's → Robert Allen → Beauty Co. → Amen Clinics → Biote. That's not a random career — it's a pattern. She's the person companies call after they've tried everything else.

### 5. Six-Industry Pattern Matcher
Automotive, retail, consumer health, neuroscience, nutraceuticals, beauty/apparel, finance. Most CEOs master one vertical. Terry reads patterns across all of them. That's rare at the national level.

### 6. National Media Platform
USA Today, Forbes, Fast Company, NY Times, Business Insider, Kiplinger, Huffington Post. Most CEOs never get into any of those once. She's been in all of them.

### 7. SEC Audit Committee Qualified
Boards desperately need directors who understand audit and risk. This credential makes her immediately recruitable.

### 8. National Voice in Women's Health
Not just a CEO — a public advocate. PharmaVOICE Top 100, WPO Top 50, speaking circuits, national conversations on menopause, brain health, and integrative medicine. She's not just an operator — she's a platform.

### 9. Elite Consulting Client List
Oracle, IBM, Electronic Arts, BP, Ford, Jiffy Lube, NAPA, Ann Taylor, Kroger, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney. Most consultants brag about one marquee client. She has 15.

### 10. Large-Scale Operator
500+ employee companies, multi-location clinic networks, national retail chains, geographically distributed service footprints, complex supply chains. Most CEOs never handle that scale.

## SAMPLE BLOG POST (For Thought Leadership Page)

**Title:** "The 11.2% Problem: Why Healthcare Boards Need Women Leaders Now"

Women are the backbone of healthcare. We manage clinics, lead nursing teams, innovate in patient care, and drive outcomes. Yet we hold only 11.2% of CEO roles.

When it comes to the boardroom, we're barely in the room.

**Key Points:**
- Gender-diverse companies are 25% more likely to outperform financially (McKinsey)
- Board recruitment lags behind available talent
- Executive search firms still operate on old networks

**Call to Action:**
- Board members: Commit to interviewing at least one qualified woman for every open seat
- Women leaders: Don't wait for an invitation. Connect with organizations like Women in Healthcare and Boardsi
